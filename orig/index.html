      <h1>Koolabung Lures</h1>
      Hi! I'm Eddie Studman, owner of Koolabung Lures. I make hand-crafted fishing lures in Port Macquarie, Australia and supply to a large number of fishing tackle stores throught the country.
      <p>Please bear with me as I upgrade the website to show my latest range of lures enjoyed by fishing enthusiasts Australia-wide.
      <br><br>
      If you would like information on any of my lures, please contact me on: (+61) 2 65 83 5752 or <a href="mailto:eskbung@optusnet.com.au">eskbung@optusnet.com.au</a>
      <div class="headingText">The History of <i>Koolabung Lures</i></div>
      My first introduction to lure fishing came on the banks of the mighty 
        Macleay, targeting Bass just 4km above Kempsey in Northern NSW. Spinning 
        Bass intrigued me enough and quickly I moved on to other quarries in saltwater 
        such as flathead.<br>
        <br>
        In 1970 my thirst for other targets was soon quenched when a good friend 
        from Sydney drew my attention to the art of luring bream. Bream spinning 
        was seen as something of a stunt in those days a by-catch of a flathead 
        session but these days has become the norm with B.R.E.A.M. series comps 
        targeting these species by lure only means.<br>
        <br>
        My profession was at that time of a self-employed painter decorator. Painting 
        gave me an insight into colour schemes helping me design appropriate attracting 
        patterns for different species of fish.</p>

    <td align="left" valign="top" width=50% class="defaultText">After designing 
      and making lures for mates and myself which worked rather well plus saved 
      me a few bucks, I decided to try and make some saleable products and break 
      into the cottage lure industry. It wasn't long before I was in full time 
      production with the demand for my lures keeping me more away from my passion 
      of fishing.<br>
      <br>
      All my products are individually and lovingly hand shaped and assembled. 
      All hooks (VMC) rings and towing clips are of the highest quality to ensure 
      a strong reliable product for all your piscatorial interludes.<br>
      <br>
      The lures I have designed are ideal for a vast array of situations and styles 
      of fishing. All lures come in a variety of sizes and
      natural and attractor colours, which should cover any water conditions in 
      both salt and fresh water applications. </td>
