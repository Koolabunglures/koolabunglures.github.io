<p align="justify" class="style4">The transparent polycarbonate bodies of X-RAY Blades, coupled with the carefully selected range of colours imitate baitfish brilliantly, and their ability to be fished in a wide variety of scenarios from sand flats to drop offs, deep water channels, rock walls and rock bars, make them a must for any fishoâ€™s tackle box.  With their minimal water resistance, blade lures have overcome the inherent problems in lure fishing deep water and pylon fishing during strong tidal flows, and the ability to adjust the towing point, thus changing the action from a tight shimmy to a strong darting action, allows X-RAY Blades to be fished in all manners of retrieval styles.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4">The X-RAY 40 and X-RAY PRAWN 45 Blades are producing amazing catches of Bream, Flathead, Mulloway, Whiting, Trevally and even Luderick over deep weed beds, in salt water estuaries, whilst the heavier X-RAY 60 Blades are producing excellent catches of Snapper and Pearl Perch on offshore reefs.  X-RAY Blades are proving to be a prolific Bass lure from late morning onwards, and as the Trout season progresses, will prove to be very successful deep water spinning for Trout, as well as flatline and downrigger trolling in fresh water impoundments.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4">Depending on water conditions and feeding activity, a conventional double hop and pause retrieve will usually see fish taking the lure readily.  Some days a slow hop and long pause works better, and on others, consistent fast hops are more successful, especially for Whiting.  Due to their high vibration level on the rise, X-RAY Blades work exceptionally well for vertical jigging in deep water, allowing the vertical water column to be worked effectively on off-shore reefs.  Always use the rear towing point for slow roll retrieves.  Vibration through the rod tip indicates when the lure is operating at the correct speed.<br />
